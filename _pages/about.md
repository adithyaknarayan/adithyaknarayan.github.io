I’m Adithya Narayan, a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Human Sensing Lab](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Fernando De la Torre](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/), and an MSCV student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My research interests center around **3D vision** and **geometry-aware learning**—especially multi-view reasoning, robust reconstruction, and understanding how vision(-language) models build 3D scene representations.

Currently, I’m exploring:
- **Multi-view reasoning / view selection** for 2D VLMs, and how 3D understanding emerges (Gaussian Splatting + depth representations; mechanistic interpretability).
- **Adversarial scene exploration** on SE(3) with ordinal objectives to expose geometry/depth failure modes (CVPR 2026, under review).

Previously, I’ve worked across research engineering and applied ML:
- **HeyGen (Research Engineering Intern)**: camera-motion conditioned video diffusion (ControlNet), large-scale SfM + pose extraction, and data filtering with flow-based signals.
- **Arintra (ML Engineer)**: RAG for medical coding, semantic retrieval (SapBERT + Qdrant), and ML deployment/versioning (MLFlow + FastAPI + GCP).
- **Klothed (ML Engineer)** (Advisor: [Prof. James O'Brien](http://obrien.berkeley.edu/)): 3D human reconstruction and fast FEM-based warping pipelines for AR.
- **Origin Health (Research Engineer)** (Advisor: Dr. Sripad Devalla): fetal imaging systems (segmentation / measurement), including a co-authored ISBI 2022 paper.

I completed my undergrad at Manipal Institute of Technology (B.Tech ECE) in 2021.
