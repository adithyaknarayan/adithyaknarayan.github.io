I'm currently a [Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/) student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I completed my undergrad with a major in Electronics and Communication with a minor in Computational Mathematics from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2021. My primary interests lie in Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics.

During my stint in the industry I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer/Applied Research Engineer. Recently, I was working at [Arintra](https://www.arintra.com/) - utilizing LLMs to solve the problem of medical coding. I also worked at [Klothed](https://getklothed.com/), where I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. James O'Brien](http://obrien.berkeley.edu/) on the problem of clothed human mesh recovery. I also explored its applications in virtual tryons during my time here.

During my undergrad, I did my thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Sripad Devalla](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=J1WuyrYAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Origin Health](https://www.originhealth.ai/), where I worked on the early detection of fetal anatomies from second-trimester ultrasound scans. Prior to this, during my senior year summer, I also worked with [Prof. Sachin Patkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/patkar) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) on a SLAM related project.
