description: Developed a face tracking system that uses Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) for face detection and applies trajectory smoothing to keep the tracking stable across video frames.
abstract: Developed a face tracking system that uses Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) for face detection and applies trajectory smoothing to keep the tracking stable across video frames. This Python-based tool processes videos to identify and track faces, outputting annotated videos that demonstrate its effectiveness. It's user-friendly, with simple setup instructions and options to customize with your own videos and reference face images, making it versatile for various applications.
